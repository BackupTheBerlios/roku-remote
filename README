=> Configuration
In irman.l find the key array (~line 188) and define whatever mappings you want.
The header files included just above it have the available keysyms in.

=> Building
I ship a flex-ed version of irman.l, so you should only have to have flex if you
change configuration (which is in irman.l).

run make

=> Running
Run ./bin/roku for help.

=> Example scripts
in the scripts/ directory there is some example configuration files for mplayer
to make it into a very simple media centre type thing.  The main limitation is
that you have to always have a video in the background of the menu (you can
pause it though).

 - Copy the scripts/mplayer/ files to ~/.mplayer
 - Set the menu-chroot path in the .mplayer/config file to your media directory
 - Set the VIDEO_PATH variable in the player script.
 
Run the player script (make sure that the roku binary is in your path, and that
the DNS name Roku resolves to your SoundBridge).
